# Pascal's Triangle

This directory contains code and information related to Pascal's Triangle.

## What is Pascal's Triangle?

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. It is often represented in a triangular form.

## Implementation

The code in this directory demonstrates how to generate Pascal's Triangle using various programming languages. Feel free to explore the implementations and use them in your projects.

## Directory Structure (Not Yet)

- `python/`: Contains Python implementations of Pascal's Triangle.
- `javascript/`: Contains JavaScript implementations of Pascal's Triangle.
- `java/`: Contains Java implementations of Pascal's Triangle.

## How to Use

Each programming language directory contains code that generates Pascal's Triangle. You can explore the code and run it in your preferred development environment.

### Python Example

```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    triangle = []

    for i in range(n):
        row = [1] * (i + 1)
        if i > 1:
            for j in range(1, i):
                row[j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]
        triangle.append(row)

    return triangle

# Example: Generate Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows
num_rows = 5
pascals_triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(num_rows)
print(pascals_triangle)
```

Feel free to explore and use the implementations in your own projects or for educational purposes.
