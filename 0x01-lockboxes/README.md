# Lockboxes

## Why Lockboxes?

The lockboxes serves as a brief overview of the project or problem statement that the candidate will be tasked with solving during the interview process. It outlines the key details such as the technology stack, the weight of the project, start and end dates, and other relevant information.

The interview process serves several purposes:

1. **Context Setting**: It provides context to the candidate about the problem they will be solving, including the technology stack they will be working with and any constraints or requirements associated with the project.

2. **Expectation Setting**: By specifying the weight of the project and the deadline, the introduction sets clear expectations for the candidate regarding the importance and urgency of the task.

3. **Assessment Criteria**: It helps the interviewer assess the candidate's understanding of the problem domain and their ability to work within given constraints and requirements.

4. **Interview Preparation**: Providing this information beforehand allows candidates to prepare for the interview by familiarizing themselves with the problem statement and relevant concepts, resources, and requirements.

**Overall**, including an introduction to lockboxes or any other project or problem statement in a technical interview helps streamline the interview process, ensure alignment between interviewer and candidate expectations, and assess the candidate's skills and capabilities effectively.

## Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

### Concepts Needed:
- **Lists and List Manipulation**:
  - Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
  - [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- **Graph Theory Basics**:
  - Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
  - [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/describing-graphs)
- **Algorithmic Complexity**:
  - Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
  - [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/)
- **Recursion**:
  - Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
  - [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)
- **Queue and Stack**:
  - Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
  - [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-queue-python-using-module-queue/)
- **Set Operations**:
  - Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
  - [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

### Unlocking Lockboxes:
To unlock the lockboxes, you need to implement a solution that efficiently determines if all boxes can be opened. The lockboxes contain keys, and each key can open one specific box. However, some boxes may be initially locked and require keys from other boxes to open them. Your solution should traverse through the boxes and keys, ensuring that each box is opened only if its corresponding key is available. If all boxes can be opened, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

# Tasks

## 0. Lockboxes
**Mandatory**

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

* Prototype:`def canUnlockAll(boxes)`
* `boxes` is a list of lists
* A key with the same number as a box opens that box
* You can assume all keys will be positive integers
	* There can be keys that do not have boxes
* The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked
* Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`

**Example Usage**

```python
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ cat main_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = __import__('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ ./main_0.py
True
True
False
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$
```
