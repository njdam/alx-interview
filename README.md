## Coding Challenges

In this section, you'll find a collection of coding challenges commonly asked during technical interviews. Each challenge includes a description, sample inputs/outputs, and a possible solution. Feel free to contribute your own solutions or add new challenges.

### Example Challenge

#### Problem:

Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

#### Input:

```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

#### Output

```
[2, 7]  # 2 + 7 = 9
```
